# ðŸ“· SightSeek
SightSeek is an Android application designed for tourists that allows them to see the principal historical landmarks in several cities around the world, such as Paris, Lisboa, and Washington.

The following software is designed with Ionic Framework, based on AngularJS and Capacitor, and designed with TypeScript and JavaScipt as the main programming languages. This is an Android targeted application that was built through Android Studio, with a Gradle engine. A demo of the following project can be seen below:
